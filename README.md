# Image Gallary with React

This is a simple guide on how to set up a React project with Vite, along with instructions for installation, building, running, and deploying the project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: Download and install it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-vite-setup.git
   cd react-vite-setup
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

## Development

To start the development server and work on your React project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open your project in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build

To create a production-ready build of your React application, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized and minified production files in the `dist` folder.

## Deployment

To deploy your React application, you can follow the deployment instructions for the hosting platform of your choice. Below are some common options:

- Netlify: [Netlify Deployment Guide](https://docs.netlify.com/)
- Vercel: [Vercel Deployment Guide](https://vercel.com/docs)
- GitHub Pages: [GitHub Pages Deployment Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

Make sure to update your deployment settings to point to the `dist` directory for your production build.
